Display adoptable pets from an Adopt-a-Pet.com shelter's listings.

== Description ==
This plugin provides two easy ways to display listings of adoptable pets from a shelter's profile at Adopt-a-Pet.com via iframe.

The first way is with a shortcode `pet_adoption_listings` that can be included in any post or page content. When used it will show the shelter's available pets from their Adopt-a-Pet.com profile. The only required attribute is `shelter_id` (obtained from Adopt-a-Pet.com) but you can also specify the iframe width and height.

The second way is with a widget that can display available pets in your sidebar or wherever else widgets are in your theme. You can specify the Shelter's ID (required, obtained from Adopt-a-Pet.com), the types of pets to show (defaults to All), and the height of the listing.

All pet detail links will open in a new browser window or tab on the Adopt-a-Pet.com website.

Note that the plugin loads content from a third-party site via iframe, and so may introduce cookies, tracking codes, etc. in addition to those present on your WordPress site. This plugin and widget is in no way affiliated with or endorsed by Adopt-a-Pet.com or its partners.
