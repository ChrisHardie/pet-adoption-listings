## Description

This plugin provides two easy ways to display listings of adoptable pets from a shelter's profile at Adopt-a-Pet.com via iframe.

The first way is with a shortcode `pet_adoption_listings` that can be included in any post or page content. When used it will show the shelter's available pets from their Adopt-a-Pet.com profile. The only required attribute is `shelter_id` (obtained from Adopt-a-Pet.com) but you can also specify the iframe width and height.

The second way is with a widget that can display available pets in your sidebar or wherever else widgets are in your theme. You can specify the Shelter's ID (required, obtained from Adopt-a-Pet.com), the types of pets to show (defaults to All), and the height of the listing.

All pet detail links will open in a new browser window or tab on the Adopt-a-Pet.com website.
